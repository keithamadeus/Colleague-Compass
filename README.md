## Description

I've developed a command-line application for managing a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer for user input, and PostgreSQL for database management, named Colleague Compass.

## Installation

npm i ==> run query.sql to build DB ==> run seeds in DB ==> then run 'npm run start'

## Usage

When I start the application, I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. When I select View all departments: I am shown a formatted table of department names and their IDs. When I select View all roles: Each role displays the job title, role ID, associated department, and salary. When I select View all employees: A formatted table shows each employee's ID, first name, last name, job title, department, salary, and manager. I can enter the name of a new department which is then added to the database. When I select Add a role: I input the role's name, salary, and department assignment to add it to the database. When I select Add an employee: I provide the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager to add them to the system. Last, when I select, Update Operation: Update an employee role: I select an employee from the list and update their role in the database.

## Learning Points

I was running issues, then I found out and changed inquirer to version 9.2.19 instead of 12, and it took away the 'questions' error about overloading.

As a business owner, I wanted an efficient way to manage and organize my companyâ€™s departments, roles, and employees. This application enables me to do just that, helping me plan and oversee my business operations seamlessly.
